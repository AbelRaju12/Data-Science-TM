# Data-Science-TM

-------------------------

This is a repository containing all the code and final projects I did as part of my 2-month technical training on Data Science.
The repo is split into modules and each modules contains the code and informations corresponding to the topics covered in that module.

Module 1
_____________

It covers the basic python topics including:
    - Basic operations
    - Operators
    - String Objects
    - Datastructures
    - Conditionals
    - Loops
    - Fucntions

    
Module 2
_____________

It explorers the Numpy library and its various functionalities.

  - NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
    It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
    NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.
    NumPy stands for Numerical Python.


Module 3
_____________

It explorers the Pandas library and its various features.

  - Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.
    It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.
    The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.



Module 4
_____________

It explorers the Matplotlib library specifically the pyplot module.

  - Matplotlib is a low level graph plotting library in python that serves as a visualization utility.
    Matplotlib was created by John D. Hunter.
    Matplotlib is open source and we can use it freely.

It introduces the seaborn library and its advantages.

  - Seaborn is an amazing visualization library for statistical graphics plotting in Python. It provides beautiful default styles and color palettes to make statistical plots more attractive. It is built on top matplotlib       library and is also closely integrated with the data structures from pandas.
    Seaborn aims to make visualization the central part of exploring and understanding data.
